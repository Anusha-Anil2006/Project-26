Ingredients:
4 slices of Bread  (You can use any bread, I prefer using wheat or multi-grain)
1 chopped onion
1 chopped tomato
1 chopped capsicum
1 cup boiled American sweet corn
Butter
1/2 cup grated cheese (You can choose any cheese that you like, I used Amul processed cheese cube)
4 tablespoon Tomato ketchup ( I am a sucker for ketchup, I love that tangy flavor, so I usually put 6 table spoons)
1/2 tablespoon Chaat masala (I prefer M.D.H.)
Salt and pepper as per taste.
Schezwan Sauce- optional (I used Ching’s Schezwan Chutney)
Procedure
Put all the chopped vegetables into the bowl and add ketchup, chaat masala, salt and pepper.
Mix all the of the above together. ( I always prefer to taste the mixture just to be sure that it is the way I like, so just taste it and add any of the spices or ketchup mentioned above, to suit your taste. As for me, I would usually add more ketchup and Chaat masala)
Take a slice of bread. Apply butter on the bread. If you are using Schezwan sauce then spread it on the bread after applying butter.
Spread the mixture on the bread evenly, it shouldn’t be too much or too less. 1 single layer is sufficient.
Sprinkle grated cheese on top of the bread. (I prefer grating the cheese directly on top of the bread because if you grate it first it tends to get sticky as it melts, especially when the weather is hot.)
Keep the bread slices in the Microwave or OTG at 180 ° C until the cheese melts. (I love to stand in front of the Microwave and watch the cheese melt and bubble up, it is so satisfying <3).( Make sure you keep an eye on the microwave as the cheese melts really quickly and if you don’t pull it out on time, you might burn the base of the bread.)
Take out the slices, cut them diagonally.
Sprinkle Oregano or Chilly flakes on top of the toasts (Optional)
Serve them with Tomato ketchup or green chutney or both.

Heat the pan, put 1/2 tablespoon of butter once the pan is hot.
Spread the butter all over the pan.
Put the bread slice on the pan and move then in a full circle with your fingers.
Put the gas on low heat.
Take a Steel pot that is big enough to cover the slice(s) (you can grill 2 slices at a time) and cover the slices with it.
Lift the pot in 30 Seconds to check if the cheese has melted. Also use a knife to lift the bread a little to see if its toasted. (Be very cautious when you use this technique it might sound easy but you have to be really careful, because if you don’t take off the bread slices on time, they might burn. Therefore keep a check on them, you don’t want to burn all the efforts that you have put in.)
I would suggest that you take off the slices as soon as the cheese melts and the bread turns golden brown from below.
